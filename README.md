# Project Title: Attendance Management System Using Face Recognition
# Description:
The Attendance Management System is a Python-based application that leverages face recognition technology to streamline attendance tracking. The system provides an efficient, accurate, and automated alternative to traditional methods of recording attendance.

# Features:
* Face Recognition: Uses advanced image processing libraries to detect and identify faces in real time.
* Automated Attendance: Automatically marks attendance based on recognized faces, reducing manual errors.
* Excel Integration: Stores attendance records in Excel sheets for easy management and reporting.
* User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter for a simple and intuitive user experience.
* Scalability: Can be extended to support larger groups and multiple use cases (e.g., schools, offices).
# Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Tkinter
Storage: Excel sheets (using Pandas for data management)
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/lakshmi-2003/AMS-using-Face-Recognition.git
# 2. Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt 
# 3. Install the required libraries:
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install pandas
  pip install numpy  
# 4. Run the application:
  python main.py  
Follow on-screen instructions to register faces and start tracking attendance.
# Future Enhancements:
* Integration with cloud storage for centralized attendance data.
* Adding multi-user support for use in large organizations.
* Implementing analytics for attendance trends and insights.
